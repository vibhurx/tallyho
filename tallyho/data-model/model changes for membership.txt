1.	Add Participant.seed_points for the organizer to be able to perform seeding process
	If aita_regulated then use AITA points (or use club's own point-system).
	SQL: alter table participant add column seed_points int(8) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 after category;

2.	Add Tour.is_aita & Category.is_aita_regulated (boolean).
	If yes, then pick ranking/points from membership where org_id = AITA
	Else, pick the ranking/points from membership where org_id = organization.id
	SQL:
	- alter table tour add column `is_aita` boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT true after start_date;
	- alter table category add column `is_aita` boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT true after start_date;

2a.	Add is_aita field in Tour _form as a dropdown with values "Yes"/"No"
	Add is_aita field in Category _form as a dropdown with values "Yes"/"No" 
	only if Tour->is_aita = true. Else it is fixed to false (="No")


3.	Player-list:: if aita_regualated then copy points from membership where org_id = AITA
	(Currently being copied from player.aita_points !!! NOT A GOOD IDEA)

4.	When the organizer changes the points the change be affected only in Participant table not 
	in the Player table. Default value comes from Membership(m) where m.player_id = player.id

5.	Is the seeding on the basis of the point-system maintained by the club or the ranking.
	Provide Category.seed_basis(0: points(desc), 1: rank(asc)).

6.	Member-or-not comes from membership table.





Remake draw on the following conditions
	- a new enrollment
	- a new paid/unpaid status
	- a new seeding

Throw a warning when a draw-bracket already exists
	- what should be the condition
		- Match.count(*) > 0 where tour_id and category match.
